description: Making sure only three posts appear
---
For this blog entry, my plan is to test and make sure that the LatestPosts component will only render the latest three posts that have been created. If this works, then that means the LatestPosts component should display three cards displaying entries from today, January 2020 and December 2019 (if my memory is serving me correctly).
